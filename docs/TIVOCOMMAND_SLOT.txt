Create a Custom Slot Type of TIVOCOMMAND_SLOT on the Interaction Model page 
of your Alexa skill and paste in the list of values below. 

This is basically a list of commands in the TiVo TCP Protocol not covered by 
other utterances that can be used by the "send command" command. Since some 
of these aren't pronounceable (i.e., KBDDOWN) they probably won't be 
recognized and processed, but they're here for completeness.
