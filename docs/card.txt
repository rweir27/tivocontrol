Welcome to TiVo Control! You can use this skill to voice control your TiVos through Alexa-enabled devices like the Amazon Echo or Dot.

All of the voice commands start with 'Alexa, tell/ask TiVo to ...':

TRICKPLAY
... pause
... play
... (double/triple) fast forward 
... skip/advance ahead (30 second skip)
... skip commercials (for SkipMode-enabled recordings)
... (double/triple) rewind
... replay (sends instant replay twice)
... record this show

CHANGING CHANNELS
... change/go to channel <channel number> (on/in <box name>)
... force channel <channel number> (on/in <box name>) (cancels recording if necessary)
<channel number> must be a channel enabled in your Channel List
... put on <channel name> (on/in <box name>)
<channel name> must be mapped to the proper channel number in your TiVo Control configuration (see channels.json)
... last/previous channel
... list my channels (by <genre>) (also adds a card to your Alexa app listing your named channels)
<genre> must be mapped to the proper channel number in your TiVo Control configuration (see channels.json)

ADVANCED
... type <phrase>
<phrase> can be a movie or television series
... send the <command> command

<command> can be any command defined in the TiVo TCP Remote Protocol. For example:
- KEYBOARD commands (letters, numbers, etc.)
- IRCODE commands (thumbs up/down, navigation (up, down, left, right), etc.)

Sending individual commands to the TiVo with Alexa can be cumbersome since each command needs to be issued separately (i.e., 'Alexa, tell TiVo to send the down command', 'Alexa, tell TiVo to send the select command'). For complex interactions, using the physical remote control is the better method.
